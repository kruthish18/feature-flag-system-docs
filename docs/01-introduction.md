# Introduction

This document introduces the concept, purpose, and typical use cases of a Feature Flag System. The goal is to provide an overview for developers, product managers, and technical stakeholders who intend to implement, manage, or integrate with a self-hosted feature flag platform.

## What is a Feature Flag?

A **feature flag** (also known as a feature toggle) is a software development technique that enables or disables specific functionality without deploying new code. Instead of hardcoding logic into an application, feature flags externalize control to a configuration system that can be updated dynamically.

By wrapping features or code paths in conditionals linked to flags, developers and teams can:
- Deploy code to production with features turned off
- Gradually roll out features to subsets of users
- Instantly turn features on or off based on conditions or emergencies

This approach decouples deployment from release, enabling safer and more flexible delivery pipelines.

## Benefits of Using Feature Flags

Feature flag systems offer both engineering and product advantages:

### 1. Safe Deployments
Release features with the flag turned off. Enable them selectively once deployed and verified in production.

### 2. Progressive Delivery
Gradually roll out features to a percentage of users or specific cohorts (e.g., internal team, beta testers).

### 3. A/B Testing and Experimentation
Test different versions of a feature against target segments and analyze the impact before full release.

### 4. Operational Control and Kill Switches
Use flags to instantly disable features that are misbehaving or causing system instability without triggering a rollback.

### 5. Faster Development Cycles
Decouple feature releases from long QA cycles by gating incomplete or experimental features behind flags.

### 6. Customized User Experiences
Serve different features or behaviors based on user attributes, location, device, or permissions.

## Example Use Cases

Here are some typical real-world scenarios where feature flags improve development and release workflows:

- **Staged Rollouts**: Gradually roll out a new homepage layout to 5%, then 20%, then 100% of users.
- **Beta Programs**: Enable a new search algorithm only for users in the “beta” group.
- **Incident Mitigation**: Disable a CPU-intensive feature instantly to relieve server load.
- **User Segmentation**: Show premium features only to users with a certain subscription tier.
- **Internal Testing**: Gate features to specific employee emails or IPs for testing in production environments.
- **Canary Releases**: Run a new checkout flow for 1% of traffic to monitor impact before full deployment.
