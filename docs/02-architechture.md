# System Architecture

This section outlines the high-level architecture of the Feature Flag System. The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and performant to support dynamic feature toggling at scale. It can be self-hosted and deployed in cloud or containerized environments.

The architecture follows a typical backend-service pattern with support for REST APIs, SDK-based integration, and real-time evaluation of feature flags per user context.

## High-Level Design

The system is composed of four primary components:

1. Feature Flag Store (Database)
2. Admin UI (optional)
3. API Server with Client SDK
4. Evaluation Engine

Below is a simplified system diagram:

## 1. Feature Flag Store (Database)

This is the central repository where all feature flag definitions, metadata, targeting rules, environment-specific values, and rollout strategies are stored.

- Can be implemented using a relational DB (PostgreSQL) or a document store (MongoDB)
- Stores environments (e.g., staging, production), flags, user segments, and audit logs
- Supports versioning of flag configuration

## 2. Admin UI (Optional)

The Admin UI is a web-based interface that allows product managers, developers, or release managers to:

- Create and update feature flags
- Define targeting rules and rollout strategies
- Manage user segments and environments
- View audit logs and flag history

This component is optional and can be replaced with direct API access for programmatic control.

## 3. SDK / API Server

This is the core backend service that exposes endpoints for:

- Creating, updating, and deleting flags
- Fetching flag values for specific users or requests
- Managing environments and user segments
- Serving SDK configuration and evaluation logic

The API server also acts as the point of integration for clients that do not use SDKs and prefer RESTful access.

## 4. Evaluation Engine

The evaluation engine is responsible for computing the state of a feature flag based on incoming request context, such as:

- User ID
- Environment (e.g., staging vs production)
- Device type, region, or any custom attributes

The engine supports percentage rollouts, rule-based targeting, kill switches, and default fallbacks. It is optimized for low-latency and can be embedded in SDKs or deployed as a service.

### Evaluation Flow

1. Client sends request with user context to `/evaluate`
2. API server fetches relevant flag definitions and targeting rules
3. Evaluation engine applies rules and returns a boolean or variant
4. Client applies the result to enable/disable feature code paths

## Summary

This architecture ensures that the Feature Flag System is:

- Scalable and stateless (API layer)
- Resilient with fallback mechanisms
- Easy to integrate via SDKs or direct HTTP calls
- Secure and auditable via environment-based isolation

In the next section, we will explore the specific API endpoints available for managing and evaluating feature flags.
