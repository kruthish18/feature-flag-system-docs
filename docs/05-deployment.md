# Deployment Guide

This guide outlines how to deploy the Feature Flag System in a production or staging environment. The system is designed to be cloud-native and container-friendly, with optional persistence layers and UI components.

## System Components

The following services can be deployed individually or as a unified stack:
*API Server*
*Evaluation Engine* (can be embedded)
*Flag Store* (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
*Admin UI* (optional)
*Redis* (optional for caching)

## Docker Compose (Local or Dev)

You can run the system locally using Docker Compose.

### docker-compose.yml (example)

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    image: yourorg/feature-flag-api:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - DB_URL=postgres://user:pass@db:5432/flags
      - REDIS_URL=redis://cache:6379
      - NODE_ENV=production
    depends_on:
      - db
      - cache
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: flags
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: pass
  cache:
    image: redis:6
```

### Environment Variables
| Variable      | Description                               |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| DB_URL        | Connection string for Postgres/MongoDB    |
| REDIS_URL     | Redis URL for caching                     |
| NODE_ENV      | Environment (e.g., production, staging)   |
| JWT_SECRET    | Token signing key for API access          |
| ALLOWED_ORIGINS | CORS whitelist                            |

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Kubernetes
*Helm chart support available*
*Can use Secrets and ConfigMaps for environment config*
*Horizontal scaling recommended for API Server*

### Option 2: Cloud Services
*Deploy API Server to Heroku, Render, or AWS ECS*
*Host DB on AWS RDS / Mongo Atlas*
*Use Cloudflare or API Gateway for secure access*

## Admin UI (Optional)

The Admin UI is optional and can be:
*Deployed as a separate frontend*
*Served from the API container on `/admin`*

## Security Notes
*Use HTTPS for all client-server communication*
*Use access tokens to authenticate requests*
*Apply role-based access for flag modifications*

## Summary

The system supports a variety of deployment models from local testing to scalable production environments. Once deployed, the feature flag service can power safe deployments, experiments, and real-time rollouts with minimal latency.
